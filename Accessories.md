## Power

**Important Note:**

 * Steam Deck Power Input: **45W USB Type-C PD3.0 power supply**.

 * The Steam Deck can be charged at a **maximum speed of 45W**. 

 * There’s a **5,313mAh battery** inside the Steam Deck.

 * I would recommend getting a **20,000mAh power bank** for your Steam Deck as it will charge your console multiple times.
